                About Nursing as a Profession
            </h2>
            <p>
                Nursing, as an integral part of the health care system, encompasses the promotion of health, prevention of illness, and care of physically ill, mentally ill, and disabled people of all ages, in all health care and other community settings. Within this broad spectrum of health care, the phenomena of particular concern to nurses are individual, family, and group "responses to actual or potential health problems" (ANA, 1980, P.9).
                Nursing encompasses autonomous and collaborative care of individuals of all ages, families, groups and communities, sick or well and in all settings. Nursing includes the promotion of health, prevention of illness, and the care of ill, disabled and dying people. Advocacy, promotion of a safe environment, research, participation in shaping health policy and in patient and health systems management, and education are also key nursing roles.

            <ul>

                <li>Facilitates sound decision making and makes it more explicit.</li>

                <li>Provides the nurse with the skills and knowledge to evaluate healthcare literature and practice.</li>
                <li>Exposes gaps in knowledge and conflicts evidence.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Evidence-based practice (EBP) attempts to cover gaps in patient care for better outcomes and a healthier population by blending clinical experience and evidence. Evidence-based research offers nurses a unique opportunity to expand their roles and transform patient care.
